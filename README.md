# PeterMun U.S. Stock Average

## Description


## Updates
Currently, we are still working on finding all the stocks, but V 0.1 plans to have stock updates at least once a day. 

## Stocks included
The PeterMun U.S. Stock Average takes the average price of every stock ticker above $1 in the Nasdaq (c) and New York Stock Exchange (c). We are also thinking of averaging out ytd, 5y, and 10y returns.

## Why PeterMun?
PeterMun is better than the other exchanges because the Nasdaq takes the top 100 stocks, and the S&P takes the top 500. Our stock average includes everything from small-cap to mega-cap, and stocks that cost from $1 to stocks that cost $4000.
